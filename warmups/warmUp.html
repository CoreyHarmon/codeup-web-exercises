    <h1>Warm Ups</h1>
    <p>I feel like I would like to work on making websites or apps look aesthetically appealing, kind of like web design. I am open to other options as I am very ready to learn and develop my skills to be a true full stack web dev. It would be ideal to work from home, but being my first job in the tech field, it may be beneficial to be in a hybrid style job. I would like a minimum of $70,000 so I can be closer to what I'm used to.

        HOW I will do this (SMART Goal. Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time Bound

        I want to evidently do something I enjoy. In many areas of my life, I enjoy making things look nice. First step is to graduate this course in CODEUP, but also take all the knowledge I possibly can so I can land the best job for me easier and do well. By next May, I will have an entirely new type of life, working in whatever field i figure out suits me the best, but I will know exactly in the next two months.

        Measurable - I like to make things look nice (Look for on job searches and pad resume)
