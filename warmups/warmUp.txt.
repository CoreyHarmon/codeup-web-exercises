GOAL
// I feel like I would like to work on making websites or apps look aesthetically appealing, kind of like web design. I am open to other options as I am very ready to learn and develop my skills to be a true full stack web dev. It would be ideal to work from home, but being my first job in the tech field, it may be beneficial to be in a hybrid style job. I would like a minimum of $70,000 so I can be closer to what I'm used to.
