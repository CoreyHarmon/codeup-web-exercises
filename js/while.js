 // Do-While loops exercise ice cream
// An ice cream seller can't go home until she sells all of her cones. First write enough code that generates a random number between 50 and 100 representing the amount of cones to sell before you start your loop. Inside of the loop your code should generate another random number between 1 and 5, simulating the amount of cones being bought by her clients. Use a do-while loop to log to the console the amount of cones sold to each person. The below code shows how to get the random numbers for this exercise.

// Outputs -
// 5 cones sold...  // if there are enough cones
// Cannot sell you 6 cones I only have 3...  // If there are not enough cones
// Yay! I sold them all! // If there are no more cones


// This is how you get a random number between 50 and 100
let allCones = Math.floor(Math.random() * 50) + 50;
// // This expression will generate a random number between 1 and 5
// let conesSold = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 1;

console.log(`I have ${allCones} cones`)

do{
// This expression will generate a random number between 1 and 5
    let conesSold = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 1;
   if (conesSold <= allCones) {
       console.log(conesSold + " " + "Cones sold")
       allCones -= conesSold
    }
   else {
       console.log("Cannot sell you" + " " + conesSold + " " + "cones. I only have" + " " + allCones + "...")


   }


} while (allCones !== 0)
